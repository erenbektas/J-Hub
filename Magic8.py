        The Magic 8-Ball is a plastic sphere, made to look like an oversized eight-ball, that is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. 
        It was invented in 1946 by Albert C. Carter and Abe Bookman and is currently manufactured by Mattel.
        The user asks a yesâ€“no question to the ball, then turns it over to reveal an answer in a window on the ball. 

        NOTE: You can go back to main menu by entering \"main/exit/home\"!
